# Use the await Operator with Any Thenable

[[watch the lesson]](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-use-the-await-operator-with-any-thenable)

The `await` operator is not restricted to ES2015 promises. It can be used to await any *thenable* — that is, any object with a `.then()` method. This lesson illustrates how to await promises that have been created using a promise library.

```
